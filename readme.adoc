= ELK Stack with WildFly

This document provide more details about how to setup ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for use with WildFly and the SocketHandler found in https://github.com/lOfnOrD/jboss-logmanager-ext. It is based upon all the good work done in https://github.com/arun-gupta/elk and http://wildfly.org/news/2015/07/25/Wildfly-And-ELK/.

== Run ELK Stack

. Clone the repo:

  git clone https://github.com/lOfnOrD/elk.git
  cd elk
. Run the ELK stack:

  docker-compose up -d
+
This will use the pre-built Elasticsearch, Logstack, and Kibana images.
